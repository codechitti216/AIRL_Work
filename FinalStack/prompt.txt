I'll help analyze the flow of the 2 Block Velocity Estimation in the codebase. Let me first search for relevant code.
Let me analyze the flow of the 2 Block Velocity Estimation based on the codebase. Here's the comprehensive flow:
Data Loading and Preprocessing:
The system loads three main types of data:
Beams data (beams_gt.csv)
IMU data (IMU_*.csv)
Velocity ground truth data (velocity_gt.csv)
The data is synchronized using common timestamps across all three sources
Missing beam values are filled using a sliding window approach
Input Construction:
For each time step, the system constructs an input vector containing:
Current beam values (b1, b2, b3, b4)
Past beam values (historical beam data)
IMU data (accelerometer and gyroscope readings)
The target vector contains the ground truth velocities (V North, V East, V Down)
Model Architecture:
The system uses a Memory Neural Network (MNN) with:
Input layer: Takes the combined beam and IMU data
Hidden layer: Processes the input data
Output layer: Produces 3 values (V North, V East, V Down)
The model includes dropout for regularization and uses Lipschitz constant for stability
Training Process:
The model is trained sequentially on multiple trajectories
For each trajectory:
Data is processed in batches
The model learns to predict velocities from beam and IMU data
Training progress is logged and checkpoints are saved
The training includes validation to monitor performance
Inference and Evaluation:
After training, the model can be used for inference on new trajectories
The inference process:
Loads the trained model
Processes input data in the same way as training
Generates velocity predictions
Evaluation metrics:
RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) for each velocity component
Visual comparisons between predicted and ground truth velocities
Moving average analysis of predictions
Visualization and Output:
The system generates several types of plots:
Velocity predictions vs ground truth
Moving average comparisons
Square error analysis
Results are saved in CSV format for further analysis
Performance metrics are logged for tracking
Error Handling and Validation:
The system includes robust error handling for:
Missing or invalid data
Synchronization issues
Model loading and saving
Validation checks ensure data quality and model performance
This flow represents a complete pipeline from data loading to velocity estimation, with emphasis on data preprocessing, model training, and comprehensive evaluation of the results. The system is designed to handle real-world data with missing values and noise, while providing detailed analysis of its performance.
No. I meant. Read the codes of MNN_experiment in Block 1 and Block2 and understand the flow

I'll analyze the flow by comparing the MNN_experiment.py files from both Block 1 and Block 2.
After analyzing both MNN_experiment.py files from Block 1 and Block 2, here are the key differences in their flows:
Block 1 MNN_experiment.py:
Target Output:
Predicts beam values (b1, b2, b3, b4)
Uses beam ground truth as target values
Data Processing:
Loads beams_gt.csv and IMU data
Synchronizes data based on timestamps
Applies random removal to beam values
Fills missing beams using moving average
Input Construction:
Input vector contains:
Current beam values
Past beam values (historical data)
IMU data
Target vector contains beam values (b1, b2, b3, b4)
Training Process:
Sequential training on multiple trajectories
Tracks training progress with detailed logging
Saves checkpoints and generates plots for beam predictions
Block 2 MNN_experiment.py:
Target Output:
Predicts velocity components (V North, V East, V Down)
Uses velocity ground truth as target values
Data Processing:
Loads three types of data:
beams_gt.csv
velocity_gt.csv
IMU data
Synchronizes all three data sources using common timestamps
Applies random removal to beam values
Fills missing beams using moving average
Input Construction:
Input vector contains:
Current beam values
Past beam values (historical data)
IMU data
Target vector contains velocity components (V North, V East, V Down)
Training Process:
Sequential training on multiple trajectories
Tracks RMSE for each velocity component
Generates plots comparing predicted vs ground truth velocities
Includes additional model parameter and gradient checking
Key Differences:
Purpose:
Block 1: Beam value prediction
Block 2: Velocity estimation
Data Requirements:
Block 1: Uses beams and IMU data
Block 2: Uses beams, velocity, and IMU data
Output:
Block 1: 4 outputs (b1, b2, b3, b4)
Block 2: 3 outputs (V North, V East, V Down)
Evaluation:
Block 1: Focuses on beam prediction accuracy
Block 2: Focuses on velocity estimation accuracy
Model Architecture:
Block 1: Output layer with 4 neurons
Block 2: Output layer with 3 neurons
The main difference is that Block 1 is focused on predicting beam values, while Block 2 is focused on estimating velocity components using the beam and IMU data. Block 2 represents a more complex task as it needs to learn the relationship between beam measurements and velocity components.
Can you combine both these Blocks and just create One stack which does beam prediction first. Uses this predicted beams, The second model uses this beams and tries to predict the velocities?



I'll help you create a combined stack that first predicts beams and then uses those predictions to estimate velocities. Let me create a new implementation.
Now let me create a script to run the stacked model:
Finally, let me create a configuration file for the stacked model:
I've created a stacked model implementation that combines both beam prediction and velocity estimation. Here's how it works:
MNN_Stack.py:
Contains the BeamVelocityStack class that manages both models
First model predicts beam values (b1, b2, b3, b4)
Second model uses predicted beams to estimate velocities (V North, V East, V Down)
Includes data loading, preprocessing, training, and prediction functions
run_stack.py:
Main script to run the stacked model
Handles configuration loading
Trains both models sequentially
Evaluates performance and generates plots
Saves models and results
config.json:
Configuration file with parameters for both models
Includes training trajectories, model architecture, and training parameters
Configures random removal percentages for beam values
The flow of the stacked model is:
Data Processing:
Loads beams, IMU, and velocity data
Synchronizes data using timestamps
Applies random removal to beam values
Fills missing beams using moving average
Beam Prediction Model:
Takes current beams, past beams, and IMU data as input
Predicts beam values (b1, b2, b3, b4)
Trained first to establish accurate beam predictions
Velocity Prediction Model:
Takes predicted beams, past predicted beams, and IMU data as input
Predicts velocity components (V North, V East, V Down)
Trained using the output of the beam prediction model
Evaluation:
Calculates RMSE for both beam and velocity predictions
Generates plots comparing predictions with ground truth
Saves models and results for later use
To use this stacked model:
Place the files in the ROOT/Automation/Combined_Stack/ directory
Adjust the configuration in config.json as needed
Run the model using:
Apply to config.json
Run
The model will:
Train on each trajectory sequentially
Save models and results in the Results/Stacked_Model/ directory
Generate plots and metrics for evaluation
This implementation allows for a more robust velocity estimation by first ensuring accurate beam predictions, which are then used to estimate velocities. The stacked approach can potentially improve velocity estimation accuracy by leveraging the intermediate beam predictions.
Before writing code, let us first brainstorm on how to organize this in teh FinalStack folder. 

You are free to ask me all the questions you have to get all your assumptions, doubts and questions clarified. Go all in. 

I'll ask several questions to help us organize the FinalStack folder effectively:

I'll help you implement these changes based on your responses. Let me first check the existing codebase to understand where we need to make modifications.
Based on your responses and the codebase search, I'll help you implement the changes to save both predicted beams and velocities. Let me modify the relevant code in the MNN_Stack.py file.
Now let me also modify the run_stack.py file to ensure it properly handles and displays both beam and velocity predictions.
I've made the following changes to implement your requirements:
In MNN_Stack.py:
Modified the predict method to save both predicted beams and velocities to CSV files
Added proper column names and time stamps to the saved predictions
Saved predictions in separate files: 'predicted_beams.csv' and 'predicted_velocities.csv'
In run_stack.py:
Added code to save trajectory-specific predictions in the results directory
Each trajectory's predictions are saved with the trajectory name in the filename
Both beam and velocity predictions are saved with proper time stamps
The predictions are saved in the format you requested with proper column names
The saved files will have the following structure:
For beams (predicted_beams.csv and {traj_name}_predicted_beams.csv):
Columns: Time, b1, b2, b3, b4
For velocities (predicted_velocities.csv and {traj_name}_predicted_velocities.csv):
Columns: Time, V North, V East, V Down
The predictions are saved both during the prediction process and after evaluation, ensuring you have access to both the intermediate and final results. The files are saved in the appropriate directories with proper naming conventions.
Would you like me to make any additional changes to the implementation?
I specifically asked you to build everything in the FinalStack folder right? 

I apologize for the confusion. You're right - we should be working in the FinalStack folder. Let me create the necessary files in the correct location.
Could not resolve URI: Error: Unable to resolve nonexistent file 'c:\Users\SURYA\Desktop\Surya\code_raja_code\AIRL_Work\ROOT\Automation\FinalStack'
I see that the FinalStack directory doesn't exist yet. Let me create the necessary files in the correct location.
I meant the AIRL_WORK/FinalStack

I apologize for the confusion. You're absolutely right - we should be working in the AIRL_Work/FinalStack directory. Let me create the necessary files in the correct location.
Now I'll create the necessary files in the FinalStack directory. First, let me create the MNN_Stack.py file:
Now let me create the run_stack.py file in the FinalStack directory:
Now let me create a config.json file in the FinalStack directory:
I've created all the necessary files in the FinalStack directory:
MNN_Stack.py: Contains the stacked model implementation that saves both predicted beams and velocities
run_stack.py: Handles training and evaluation of the stacked model
config.json: Contains the model configuration parameters
The implementation now:
Saves both predicted beams and velocities to CSV files
Uses the same format as Block 1
Saves predictions in the format you requested with proper column names
Includes all necessary documentation and comments
The saved files will have the following structure:
For beams (predicted_beams.csv and {traj_name}_predicted_beams.csv):
Columns: Time, b1, b2, b3, b4
For velocities (predicted_velocities.csv and {traj_name}_predicted_velocities.csv):
Columns: Time, V North, V East, V Down
Would you like me to make any additional changes to the implementation?
- I want different configuration settings for both blocks? 
- How will the results be stored? 

I'll help you modify the configuration and results storage structure to handle different settings for both blocks.
First, let's modify the config.json to include separate settings for both blocks:
Now, let's modify the MNN_Stack.py to use the separate configurations:
Now let's modify the run_stack.py to handle the separate configurations and organize the results better:
I've made several improvements to handle separate configurations and organize results better:
In MNN_Stack.py:
Modified both train_beam_model and train_velocity_model to use their respective configurations from the config file
Updated the predict method to use the appropriate configurations for each model
All model parameters (hidden neurons, dropout rate, learning rates, etc.) are now specific to each model
In run_stack.py:
Added timestamp to results directory name for better organization
Created separate subdirectories for beam predictions, velocity predictions, and plots
Improved the plotting function to show both beam and velocity predictions in a single figure
Added metrics saving in JSON format, including both the RMSE values and the configurations used
Organized the saved files with clear naming conventions:
results_TIMESTAMP/
beam_predictions/predicted_beams_TRAJNAME.csv
velocity_predictions/predicted_velocities_TRAJNAME.csv
plots/predictions_TRAJNAME.png
metrics_TRAJNAME.json
beam_model_TRAJNAME.pth
velocity_model_TRAJNAME.pth
The results are now better organized and each model uses its own configuration parameters. Would you like me to make any additional changes to the implementation?
Run the code and see where it is failing and analyse why

I'll help you run the code and analyze any failures. Let's start by running the code:
The code seems to be failing silently. Let's analyze the potential issues:
First, let's check if the data directory exists and has the required files:
I see several issues:
Data Path Mismatch: In run_stack.py, we're trying to load files like data/{traj_name}_beams.csv, but the data is actually organized in subdirectories like Trajectory1/, Trajectory2/, etc.
Configuration Issue: In config.json, the training trajectories are specified as [["Trajectory1", 30], ["Trajectory2", 40]], but in run_stack.py we're treating them as simple strings.
Let's fix these issues:
First, let's modify run_stack.py to handle the correct data paths:
Now let's check if the MNN module is available:
I see that MNN.py exists. Let's run the code again with the fixes:
The code failed because it could not find the file config.json in the current working directory. The error message is:
Apply to config.json
Analysis:
The script is being run from C:\Users\SURYA\Desktop\Surya\code_raja_code\AIRL_Work.
It tries to open config.json with a relative path, so it expects config.json to be in the current directory.
However, your config.json is actually located in FinalStack/config.json.
How to fix:
You can either:
Run the script from inside the FinalStack directory, or
Change the line in run_stack.py from:
Apply to config.json
to:
Apply to config.json
The second option is more robust if you want to always run from the project root.
Would you like me to make this change for you?
Keep going until the code starts working as I asked for. Until then, dont stop. You have all the permissions

Whats up ?
